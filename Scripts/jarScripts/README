Process:
1. First create sorted runs of edge files by using do-sort.sh on the LDBC directory
2. Run schema.gremlin to create the required schema and indexes
3. Run reader.gremlin which will start loading from the LDBC csv files

NOTE: the directory names in the schema and reader gremlin scripts have to be modified to point to the appropriate locations
