This project is a proof of concept that rewiring of the Graph database to add strongly coupled Index Trees within the graph schema itself offer an attractive method of preventing dependency of graph databases on external structures for indexing the database. Thus they can be effective in preventing calls to external services for this purpose and reducing the application level overheads of external index creation and usage.\\
\\
Further, since the external indexes are Hash Indexes in most cases, using the B-Tree indexes can offer better performance in some workloads especially those involving range queries. Storing indexes internally can also help to remove restrictions in using them for graph traversal based queries since most of the currently used indexes are same as those in SQL Databases.
